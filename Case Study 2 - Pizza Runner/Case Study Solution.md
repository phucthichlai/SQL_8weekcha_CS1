## Questions: B. Runner and Customer Experience

###  1. How many runners signed up for each 1 week period? (i.e. week starts 2021-01-01)

```sql
select (DATEDIFF(DAYOFYEAR, '2021-01-01', registration_date)/7+1) as registered_week, 
count(DATEDIFF(DAYOFYEAR, '2021-01-01', registration_date)/7+1) as runner_reg
from runners
group by (DATEDIFF(DAYOFYEAR, '2021-01-01', registration_date)/7+1)
```

#### Result set:
| registered_week | runner_reg |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| 1        	  | 2          |
| 2        	  | 1          |
| 3        	  | 1          |

###  2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?

```sql
with t1 as (
select co.order_id, order_time, pickup_time,
DATEDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, pickup_time) as minute_track
from customer_orders as co left JOIN runner_orders as ro ON
co.order_id = ro.order_id
where pickup_time != 'null')

select AVG(minute_track) as average_time
from t1
```

#### Result set:
| average_time |
| ------------ |
| 18           |

###  3. Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?

-> Assume the runner always reaches the HQ before the food has been prepared, so the period from order to pickup would be the time for preparation.

```sql
select co.order_id, count(co.pizza_id) as pizza_count,
DATEDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, pickup_time) as minute_track
from customer_orders as co left JOIN runner_orders as ro ON
co.order_id = ro.order_id
where pickup_time != 'null'
group by co.order_id, DATEDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, pickup_time)
order by DATEDIFF(MINUTE, order_time, pickup_time)
```

#### Result set:
| order_id   |  pizza_count  | minute_track |
| ---------- |  ------------ | ------------ |
| 1          |  1   	     | 10           |
| 2          |  1   	     | 10           |
| 5          |  1   	     | 10           |
| 7          |  1   	     | 10           |
| 10         |  2   	     | 16           |
| 3          |  2   	     | 21           |
| 8          |  1   	     | 21           |
| 4          |  3   	     | 30           |

-> there seems to be a positive relationship between pizza count and preparation time in each order.

### 4. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?

* Removing messy values by Update function -> convert data type to FLOAT -> Manipulation

```sql
update runner_orders
set distance = case(distance as float)

update runner_orders
set duration = case(duration as float)

select customer_id, AVG(distance) as avg_distance
from customer_orders as co LEFT JOIN runner_orders as ro ON
co.order_id = ro.order_id
where distance != 0
group by customer_id
```

#### Result set:
| customer_id | avg_distance |
| ----------- | ------------ |
| 101         | 20           |
| 102         | 16,733       |
| 103         | 23,399       |
| 104         | 10           |
| 105         | 25           |

###  5. What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?

```sql
select max(duration)-min(duration) as delivery_time_diff
from runner_orders
where duration != 0
```

#### Result set:
| delivery_time_diff |
|  ----------------  |
|  30                |

###  6. What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?

```sql
select runner_id, avg(distance) as avg_distance, avg(duration) as avg_duration
from runner_orders
where duration!=0
group by runner_id
```

#### Result set:
| runner_id  |  avg_distance | avg_duration |
| ---------- |  ------------ | ------------ |
| 1          |  15,85        | 22,25        |
| 2          |  23,933       | 26,66        |
| 3          |  10   	     | 15           |

###  7. What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?

```sql
with t1 as (
select runner_id, 
case 
when pickup_time != 'null' then 1.0
else 0
end as success
from runner_orders
)
select runner_id, sum(success)/count(success)*100 as success_rate
from t1
group by runner_id
```

#### Result set:
| runner_id | success_rate |
| --------- | ------------ |
| 1         | 100          |
| 2         | 75,00        |
| 3         | 50,00        |

## Questions: C.Ingredient Optimisation

### 1. What are the standard ingredients for each pizza?

â€¢ Change topping data type -> varchar
```sql
--alter table pizza_recipes 
--alter column toppings VARCHAR(40)
```
- Change topping name data type -> varchar
```sql
--alter table pizza_toppings 
--alter column topping_name VARCHAR(15)
```
- Remove ' ' value
```sql
--update pizza_recipes 
--set toppings = REPLACE(toppings,' ','')
```

#### ---> split topping id into rows

```sql
with t1 as (
select pizza_id, [value] as topping_id from pizza_recipes
cross APPLY string_split(toppings, ',')
)
```

| pizza_id | topping_id |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1        | 1          |
| 1        | 2          |
| 1        | 3          |
| 1        | 4          |
| 1        | 5          |
| 1        | 6          |
| 1        | 8          |
| 1        | 10         |
| 2        | 4          |
| 2        | 6          |
| 2        | 7          |
| 2        | 9          |
| 2        | 11         |
| 2        | 12         |

#### ---> join with topping name and combine again

```sql
select pizza_name, string_agg(topping_name, ',') as ingredients
from t1 left JOIN pizza_toppings ON
t1.topping_id = pizza_toppings.topping_id
left join pizza_names ON
t1.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id
group by pizza_name
```

#### Result set:

| pizza_name | topping_id						      |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Meatlovers | Bacon,BBQ Sauce,Beef,Cheese,Chicken,Mushrooms,Pepperoni,Salami |
| Vegetarian | Cheese,Mushrooms,Onions,Peppers,Tomatoes,Tomato Sauce	      |

***
### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?

#### Remove unnecessary blank space
```sql
update customer_orders
set extras = REPLACE(extras, ' ','')
```

#### Split
```sql
with t1 as (
select order_id, [value] as single_extra 
from customer_orders
CROSS APPLY string_split(extras, ',')
)
```

#### Combine 3 tables
```sql
select top 1 topping_name, count(topping_name) as total
from t1 join runner_orders ON
t1.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
join pizza_toppings ON
t1.single_extra = pizza_toppings.topping_id
where pickup_time != 'null'
group by topping_name
order by total desc
```

#### Result set:
| topping_name | total |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Bacon        | 3     |

***
### 3. What was the most common exclusion?

#### Remove unnecessary blank space
```sql
update customer_orders
set exclusions = REPLACE(exclusions, ' ','')
```

#### execute
```sql
with t1 as (
select order_id, [value] as single_exclu 
from customer_orders
CROSS APPLY string_split(exclusions, ',')
)
select topping_name, count(topping_name) as total
from t1 join runner_orders ON
t1.order_id = runner_orders.order_id
join pizza_toppings ON
t1.single_exclu = pizza_toppings.topping_id
where pickup_time != 'null'
group by topping_name
order by total desc
```

#### Result set:
| topping_name | total |
| ------------ | ----- |
| Cheese       | 3     |
| Mushrooms    | 1     |
| BBQ Sauce    | 1     |

### 4. Generate an order item for each record in the customers_orders table in the format of one of the following:
â€¢ Meat Lovers
â€¢ Meat Lovers - Exclude Beef
â€¢ Meat Lovers - Extra Bacon
â€¢ Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Bacon - Extra Mushroom, Peppers

#### *Confession: I gave up on generating the last option (exclude or extras more than 1), so this is only for generating the first 3 options

#### step 1. split the values into seperate rows and save the results into a temp table #ex
```sql
drop table #ex
with t1 as (
select order_id, pizza_id, [value] as single_exclusions, extras from customer_orders
outer apply string_split(exclusions,',')
)
select order_id, pizza_id, single_exclusions, [value] as single_extras
into #ex from t1
outer apply string_split(extras,',')
order by order_id
select * from #ex
```

| order_id | pizza_id | single_exclusions | extras |
| -------- | -------- | 	--------  |------- |
| 3	   |1	      |NULL	          |NULL	   |
| 3	   |2	      |NULL		  |NULL	   |
| 4	   |1	      |4		  |NULL	   |
| 4	   |1	      |4		  |NULL	   |
| 4	   |2	      |4		  |NULL	   |
| 5	   |1	      |NULL		  |1	   |
| 6	   |2	      |NULL		  |NULL	   |
| 7	   |2	      |NULL		  |1	   |
| 8	   |1	      |NULL		  |NULL	   |
| 9	   |1	      |4		  |1	   |
| 9	   |1	      |4		  |5	   |
| 10	   |1	      |NULL		  |NULL	   |
| 10	   |1	      |2		  |1	   |
| 10	   |1	      |2		  |4	   |
| 10	   |1	      |6		  |1	   |
| 10	   |1	      |6		  |4	   |

#### step 2. replace pizza name, exclusions name, and extras name with their ids, then save into #exname
```sql
drop table #exname
select order_id, pizza_name, pt1.topping_name as exclusions_name, pt2.topping_name as extras_name
into #exname 
from #ex 
left join pizza_toppings pt1 ON
#ex.single_exclusions = pt1.topping_id
left join pizza_toppings pt2 ON
#ex.single_extras = pt2.topping_id
left join pizza_names ON
#ex.pizza_id = pizza_names.pizza_id
```

#### step 3. execute
```sql
select *,
case
    when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' and exclusions_name = 'Cheese' and extras_name = 'Bacon' then 'Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese, Extras Bacon'
    when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' and exclusions_name = 'Cheese' and (extras_name != 'Bacon' or extras_name is null) then 'Meat Lovers - Exclude Cheese'
    when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' and (exclusions_name != 'Cheese' or exclusions_name is null) and extras_name = 'Bacon' then 'Meat Lovers - Extras Bacon'
    when pizza_name = 'Meatlovers' and exclusions_name is null and extras_name is null then 'Meat Lovers'
end as Details
from #exname
```
