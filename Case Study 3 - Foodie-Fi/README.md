## Introduction
ubscription based businesses are super popular and Danny realised that there was a large gap in the market - he wanted to create a new streaming service that only had food related content - something like Netflix but with only cooking shows!

Danny finds a few smart friends to launch his new startup Foodie-Fi in 2020 and started selling monthly and annual subscriptions, giving their customers unlimited on-demand access to exclusive food videos from around the world!

Danny created Foodie-Fi with a data driven mindset and wanted to ensure all future investment decisions and new features were decided using data. This case study focuses on using subscription style digital data to answer important business questions.

## Problem Statement
Because Danny had a few years of experience as a data scientist - he was very aware that data collection was going to be critical for his businessâ€™ growth.

He has prepared for us an entity relationship diagram of his database design but requires further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runnerâ€™s operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema - be sure to include this reference within your SQL scripts as you start exploring the data and answering the case study questions.

## Case Study Questions

  ### A. Customer Journey

Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.

Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

### B. Data Analysis Questions

1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
6. What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their initial free trial?
7. What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5 plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
8. How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
9. How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly plan in 2020?

### C. Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

* monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
* upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
* upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
* once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

  Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
  
### D. Outside The Box Questions

The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a business perspective make an amazing impression!
1. How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
2. What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track over time to assess performance of their overall business?
3. What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would analyse further to improve customer retention?
4. If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions would you include in the survey?
5. What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of your ideas?
